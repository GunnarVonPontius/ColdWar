 POLITICS_FRANCISCO_FRANCO_DESC:0 "Caudillo Francisco Franco has been governing Spain for a decade now. For most of his rule Spain has been rebuilding itself, but now that the dust of the Second World War has settled this task is increasinly difficult due to the old alliances and Spain's government. If Franco wants to see Spain succeed (or more importantly see it for himself) he must take some decisions that not everyone agrees with."
