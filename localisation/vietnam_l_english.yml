 POLITICS_BAO_DAI_DESC:0 "Bao Dai was the last emperor of Vietnam, and served as the first chief of state for the State of Vietnam. Bao Dai was an ineffectual ruler, largely indifferent to the goings-on of his home country until it was too late. He was eventually supplanted by the Prime Minister he appointed, Ngo Dinh Diem, after an allegedly fraudulent 1955 referendum."
 POLITICS_NGO_DINH_DIEM:0 "Ngo Dinh Diem was the first president of the Republic of Vietnam after winning an allegedly fraudulent election. His reign progressively deteriorated as he silenced political opposition, organized a highly nepotistic military, and displayed a great deal of favoritism toward Catholicism while simultaneously suppressing the native Buddhist culture. South Vietnam was already weak when he came to power. By the time Diem was deposed and executed, he had managed to further alienate the overwhelming bulk of his population, failed to make any meaningful reforms, and left a state and military apparatus that was corrupt and even weaker than when he had taken control. Only American support and tight control over the military kept South Vietnam from succumbing to popular forces during his reign."
 SVN_form_anv:0 "Expand the National Army"
 SVN_form_anv_desc:0 "The ANV (Army Nationale Vietnamienne) was formed in the late 1940s. During the First Indochina War, recruitment and control of the French Union forces in Indochina was gradually handed off to the State of Vietnam, and the ANV would eventually form the basis for the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN)."
 SVN_light_brigades:0 "Light Brigades"
 SVN_light_brigades_desc:0 "We need smaller and more mobile regular forces if we are going to keep pace with the Viet Minh. Light Brigades are small, mobile, well-armed, and well-trained -- seemingly perfect for the wilderness of Indochina."
 SVN_sgb_units:0 "SGBs"
 SVN_sgb_units_desc:0 "Sous-groupements Blindees are armored cavalry units, essentially light tank formations with a bit of infantry and reconnaissance support, typically employed for rear echelon security and rapid response in the Red River Delta region. With some equipment and training from France, we can establish a handful more of these units."
 SVN_groupes_mobiles:0 "Groupes Mobiles"
 SVN_groupes_mobiles_desc:0 "Groupes Mobiles are lightweight, independent motorized units. Having a few more of these will greatly improve our strategic effectiveness."
 SVN_airborne_corps:0 "Vietnamese Airborne Corps"
 SVN_airborne_corps_desc:0 "The ANV's own airborne corps is proving to be a deadly and effective commando element. Let's bring in some French paratroopers and establish our own airborne schools."
 SVN_marine_corps:0 "Vietnamese Marine Corps"
 SVN_marine_corps_desc:0 "To expand our tactical ability, we should look to the United States Marine Corps for inspiration -- their ability to tackle marshy and river-laden terrain with LVTs would be fantastic to have for our own native terrain. Let's bring in some American advisors to form our own Marine Corps."
 SVN_french_aid_1:0 "Request Aid from France"
 SVN_french_aid_1_desc:0 "We can request additional supplies from France to refit and resupply our troops in Indochina."
 SVN_french_aid_2:0 "Request Aid from France"
 SVN_french_aid_2_desc:0 "We can request additional supplies from France to refit and resupply our troops in Indochina."

 SVN_french_aid_4:0 "Request Aid from France"
 SVN_french_aid_4_desc:0 "We can request additional supplies from France to refit and resupply our troops in Indochina."
 SVN_french_cas:0 "Request CAS Aircraft from France"
 SVN_french_cas_desc:0 "One of the issues plaguing our operations in Indochina is the lack of air power. We should request some wings of CAS to help support our troops."
 SVN_french_transports:0 "Request Transport Aircraft from France"
 SVN_french_transports_desc:0 "If we can get a few transport aircraft from france, we can better use our airborne units."
 SVN_american_cas:0 "Request CAS Aircraft from America"
 SVN_american_cas_desc:0 "We should expand our CAS inventory by requesting some surplus from the United States."
 SVN_expand_vnaf:0 "Expand the Vietnamese Air Force"
 SVN_expand_vnaf_desc:0 "We need to establish schools for our air force elements."
 SVN_geneva_accords:0 "The 1954 Geneva Accords"
 SVN_geneva_accords_desc:0 "In 1954 the Geneva Accords were held to solve a few international issues, among them the First Indochina War. A ceasefire was ordered, and France almost immediately withdrew from Indochina. In essence, we are on our own."
 SVN_appoint_diem:0 "Appoint Ngo Dinh Diem"
 SVN_appoint_diem_desc:0 "Bao Dai met with the exiled Ngo Dinh Diem around the time of the Geneva Accords. Diem was offered the position of Prime Minister, but would only accept on the condition that Diem was given military and governmental control. For reasons unknown, Bao Dai accepted these conditions. Regardless, there was some hope that Diem could stabilize South Vietnam."
 SVN_dissolve_binh_xuyen:0 "Dissolve Binh Xuyen"
 SVN_dissolve_binh_xuyen_desc:0 "The Binh Xuyen crime syndicate was in essence a secret police created and supported by Bao Dai to maintain control over his position. Dissolving it and rolling it into the ANV would go a long ways toward undermining Bao Dai's rulership."
 SVN_force_nguyen_hinh_out:0 "Force Nguyen Hinh Into Exile"
 SVN_force_nguyen_hinh_out_desc:0 "Nguyen Van Hinh was the leader of the ANV on Ngo Dinh Diem's accession to Prime Minister. Hinh was a staunch opponent to Diem, and made motions toward deposing Diem. We need to force him out of his position if we are to consolidate power."
 SVN_diem_referendum:0 "Arrange Referendum for Republic"
 SVN_diem_referendum_desc:0 "As the last move to eliminate Bao Dai's influence and consolidate power in South Vietnam, Diem arranged a referendum for late 1955, concerning whether or not to establish a Republic and who should lead Vietnam."
 SVN_form_government:0 "Form a Government"
 SVN_form_government_desc:0 "Establishing a popularly-elected national government for Vietnam was the American diplomats' preferred method to legitimizing Diem's rulership. Historically, Diem ignored the Americans, but Diem had also been a proponent of democratic reform in Indochina earlier in life, so it was not entirely out of the realm of possibility."
 SVN_one_man_rule:0 "Democratic One-Man Rule"
 SVN_one_man_rule_desc:0 "Historically, Ngo Dinh Diem elected not to form a proper government. Instead, he went about essentially installing himself as a dictator, garnering ninety percent or more of the vote -- a clear indication of an utterly fraudulent election. Not only did this damage his standing on the international stadium, but began a downward trend that greatly weakened not just his government, but South Vietnam as an entity."
 SVN_diem_constitution:0 "Diem's Constitution"
 SVN_diem_constitution_desc:0 "Diem formed a legislative assembly in 1956 with the task of establishing a constitution for South Vietnam. Although it was, as was typical of Diem's political suppression, stacked with pro-Diem deputies, it nonetheless shows something of some democratic nature."
 SVN_conservative_law:0 "Conservative Law"
 SVN_conservative_law_desc:0 "Diem instituted a number of social laws and policies. These largely favored specific groups -- friends and family, as well as Catholics. Needless to say, the policies were  highly unpopular."
 SVN_celebrate_heritage:0 "Celebrate Vietnamese Heritage"
 SVN_celebrate_heritage_desc:0 "Although Diem largely favored the catholic elements within the Republic, he nonetheless encouraged the celebration and unity of Vietnam as a historical entity."

 SVN_can_lao_economics_desc:0 "Diem attempted to institute a wide array of economic and social policies, largely based on his Personalist ideology. "
 SVN_land_reform:0 "Land Reform"
 SVN_land_reform_desc:0 "South Vietnamese land reform had been attempted numerous times. Diem took a number of tacks on the subject, which first included land redistribution (except for lands held by the Catholic Church)."
 SVN_resettlement:0 "Resettlement"
 SVN_resettlement_desc:0 "One of the other ways that Diem attempted land reform was to resettle peasantry from place to place more evenly. Naturally, this was not a popular policy."
 SVN_rent_reduction:0 "Rent Reduction"
 SVN_rent_reduction_desc:0 "One of the other ways that Diem attempted land reform was to declare ordinances regarding rent, which reduced peasant rent by up to 25%. This was a more successful policy, but nowhere near as successful as Viet Minh policies."
 SVN_stabilize_the_budget:0 "Stabilize the Budget"
 SVN_stabilize_the_budget_desc:0 "One of our most significant undertakings is the stabilization of our out of control budget."
 SVN_rural_infrastructure_projects:0 "Rural Infrastructure Projects"
 SVN_rural_infrastructure_projects_desc:0 "As the First Indochina War showed, the utterly abysmal state of our rural infrastructure is not just inconvenient, but dangerous. We should strive toward building up our infrastructure so that when the next struggle comes, we are ready."
 SVN_develop_our_industry:0 "Develop Our Industry"
 SVN_develop_our_industry_desc:0 "Developing our industry is a vital part of becoming a self-sustaining nation. If we are to survive, we must be able to produce our own goods for ourselves."
 SVN_diem_five_year_plan:0 "First Five Year Plan"
 SVN_diem_five_year_plan_desc:0 "Like many other leaders at the time, Diem devised a five year economic plan designed to further develop industry and infrastructure, particularly in rural areas."

 SVN_university_system_2_desc:0 "If we expand our education system to include the rural peasantry, we can reach minds that might have otherwise gone to waste in the fields."

 POLITICS_NGO_DINH_DIEM_DESC:0 "Ngo Dinh Diem was one of the most influential leaders in South Vietnam's history -- and generally not in a good way. While he made some headway in stabilizing the country, many of his policies would ultimately prove detrimental not only to his rule, but to the viability of the Republic of Vietnam as an entity."

 indochina.1.t:0 "1954 Geneva Accords"
 indochina.1.d:0 "Midway through 1954, as it became increasingly apparent that the war in Indochina was unwinnable to the French government, there were motions made to begin talks to withdraw from the region. In parallel with the resolution of the Korean War, delegations from the major nations met to negotiate an end to the First Indochina War and a partition thereof. It was decided to split Vietnam into North and South, under the condition that the two would hold elections on reunification by 1956."
 indochina.1.a:0 "A much-needed respite."
